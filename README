this repository contains R code for the analysis used to compare the proportion of ancestry on the X chromosome for the HapMap MXL samples to the proportion of ancestry on the autosomes. Various methods were used to do this, including a t-test and a non-parametric sign test. There looked to be a significant difference of the proportion of ancestry on the X chromosome as compared to the autosomes, when considering any of the methods described above.
